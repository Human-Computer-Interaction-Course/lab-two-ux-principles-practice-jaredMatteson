                    <p>For getting more perfromance out of their site they could get rid of unused JavaScript. Another thing they
                        could do and this seemed to have the biggest impact was updating the images to next gen formats.
                    </p>
                <li>Accessibility</li>
                    <p> One thing they could do is improve the quality of contrast they have on some of their fonts/backgrounds. 
                        Another thing they oculd do is fix their altnerative text on their images in case some of them fail to load properly.
